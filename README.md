# NLP Pipeline with BERT using Amazon SageMaker Pipelines

This repository contains the code and materials for a series of labs focusing on building, training, and deploying Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines using BERT and Amazon SageMaker Pipelines.

## Labs Overview

### 1. Feature Engineering and Feature Store
In this lab, you will learn how to transform a raw text dataset into machine learning features and efficiently store these features in the Amazon SageMaker Feature Store. This step is crucial for preparing your data for NLP tasks.

### 2. Train, Debug, and Profile a Machine Learning Model
This lab dives into the fine-tuning, debugging, and profiling of a pre-trained BERT model. You will gain insights into optimizing your model for specific NLP tasks and understand its performance characteristics.

### 3. Deploy End-To-End Machine Learning Pipelines
In this lab, you will learn how to orchestrate end-to-end ML workflows. You'll also explore tracking model lineage and artifacts, ensuring a streamlined deployment process for your NLP models.
